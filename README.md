- 👋 Hi, I’m **Nirmal**
- 👀 I’m interested in Engineering -
- #Wireless massive MIMO systems, Multicarrier Modulation Techniques like OFDM. Wireless MIMO diversity Techniques, Beamforming.
  #Optical communication optical links end to end long haul, Analysis of Non-Linear Effects introduced in the Optical Fibers.
  #Digital Signal Processing- Modulation Schemes,Digital/Analog/Hybrid system Architectures, Algorithms for Equalization and channel estimation Techniques
  #Radar Detection and Estimation Theory.
  #Design of Active Antenna Systems - Solid State Power Amplifiers, Direct Radiating Arrays(DRA) are the future
  #LTE,5G-NR.
  #Satellite Communication Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently a Master's degree student in Communication Engineering at University of Parma/Italy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all the things in the Communication world, that i havn't been exposed to yet for active and passive learning.
